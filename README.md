# Next.js Internship Capstone Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

A collaborative project management tool built with Next.js 14+ App Router, designed as the capstone project for a 12-week full-stack development internship program.

### 📋 What We're Building

A modern, Kanban-style project management application similar to Trello or Asana, featuring:

- **User Authentication** with Clerk
- **Project & Task Management** with CRUD operations
- **Interactive Kanban Board** with drag-and-drop
- **Real-time Collaboration** features
- **Responsive Design** with Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, interns will demonstrate proficiency in:

- ✅ **Full-Stack Next.js Development** (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions)
- ✅ **Secure Authentication** (Clerk integration)
- ✅ **Database Design & Management** (PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM)
- ✅ **State Management** (Zustand for client-side state)
- ✅ **Professional Git Workflow** (GitHub Flow, PR reviews)
- ✅ **Testing Strategy** (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- ✅ **Production Deployment** (Vercel CI/CD)

## 📅 Timeline

- **Duration**: 10-12 weeks
- **Team Size**: 7 interns
- **Structure**: Collaborative development using GitHub Projects for task management
