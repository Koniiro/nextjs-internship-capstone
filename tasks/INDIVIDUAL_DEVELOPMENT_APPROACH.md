# Individual Project Development - 7 Parallel Implementations

## Overview

Each of the 7 interns will build their own complete version of the project management tool. This ensures everyone gets the full learning experience across all aspects of full-stack development, from setup to deployment.

## Individual Development Approach

### Why Individual Projects?
- **Fair Learning**: Everyone experiences all aspects of development
- **Complete Ownership**: Each intern owns their entire codebase
- **Portfolio Building**: Each intern has a complete project for their portfolio
- **Comprehensive Skills**: No one misses out on any part of the stack
- **Individual Pacing**: Interns can work at their own pace while following milestones

### Repository Structure
Each intern will have their own branch and implementation:

```
main/
├── intern-1-[name]/     # Individual implementation branches
├── intern-2-[name]/
├── intern-3-[name]/
├── intern-4-[name]/
├── intern-5-[name]/
├── intern-6-[name]/
└── intern-7-[name]/
```

## Project Board Organization

### GitHub Projects Setup
We'll use GitHub Projects with intern names as assignees/labels:

#### Column Structure
- **📋 Backlog** - All available tasks
- **🎯 Sprint (Current Week)** - Tasks for current week
- **👨‍💻 In Progress** - Tasks being worked on
- **👀 Review** - Tasks in code review
- **✅ Done** - Completed tasks

#### Task Assignment Format
Each task will include the intern's name:

**Example Issue Titles:**
- `[Sarah] 1.1 Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript`
- `[John] 2.3 Create sign-in and sign-up pages`
- `[Maria] 3.2 Configure PostgreSQL database`

#### Labels for Organization
- `week-1`, `week-2`, etc. - Timeline tracking
- `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
- `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `auth`, `testing`
- `intern-sarah`, `intern-john`, `intern-maria`, etc.

## Shared Learning & Collaboration

### Despite Individual Development, We Collaborate On:

#### 1. Knowledge Sharing
- **Daily Standups**: Share progress, blockers, solutions
- **Code Review Sessions**: Review each other's approaches
- **Technical Discussions**: Debate different implementation strategies
- **Pair Programming**: Optional pairing for difficult problems

#### 2. Standards & Conventions
- **Shared Documentation**: Common setup guides and best practices
- **Code Standards**: Same ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs
- **Git Conventions**: Consistent commit messages and PR formats
- **Testing Standards**: Same testing frameworks and patterns

#### 3. Problem Solving
- **Blocked? Ask the Team**: Anyone can help anyone
- **Solution Sharing**: Share discoveries and breakthroughs
- **Code Reviews**: Optional cross-reviews for learning
- **Retrospectives**: Weekly reflection on what's working

## Individual Project Milestones

## Branch Strategy

### Individual Branch Naming
```
main
├── feature/sarah-jones/auth-setup
├── feature/john-doe/database-schema
├── feature/maria-garcia/kanban-board
├── fix/alex-smith/drag-drop-bug
└── docs/taylor-brown/setup-guide
```

### Merge Strategy
- **Individual branches**: Never merge to main (keep separate)
- **Shared documentation**: Can merge documentation updates
- **Bug fixes in docs**: Can merge shared resource fixes
- **Feature sharing**: Can create shared branches for optional collaboration

## Showcase & Comparison

### End of Project Showcase
Each intern will demo their individual implementation:

#### Individual Presentations (15 min each)
- **Demo**: Live demonstration of all features
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Explain interesting technical decisions
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Share biggest challenges and how they solved them
- **What They'd Do Differently**: Reflections and learnings

#### Group Discussion
- **Approach Comparison**: Compare different implementation strategies
- **Best Practices**: Identify patterns that worked well across projects
- **Learning Highlights**: Share biggest learning moments
- **Future Improvements**: Ideas for continued development

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Individual Learning
- ✅ **Complete Experience**: Everyone builds the full stack
- ✅ **Portfolio Project**: Each intern has a complete project
- ✅ **Problem-Solving Skills**: Handle all types of challenges
- ✅ **Ownership**: Complete responsibility for their codebase
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can explore different approaches

### For Team Learning
- ✅ **Knowledge Sharing**: Learn from 7 different approaches
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Identify what works across implementations
- ✅ **Collaboration Skills**: Help each other while maintaining independence
- ✅ **Code Review Experience**: Review different coding styles and approaches
- ✅ **Communication**: Daily standups and technical discussions

## Project Board Task Template

### Individual Task Format
```markdown
## [Intern Name] Task Title

**Assigned to**: @intern-github-username
**Sprint**: Week X
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Category**: Frontend/Backend/Database/Testing

### Description
Clear description of what needs to be implemented.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable criteria
- [ ] That define when the task is complete
- [ ] Include testing requirements

### Notes
- Any specific requirements or constraints
- Links to documentation or examples
- Dependencies on other tasks

### Definition of Done
