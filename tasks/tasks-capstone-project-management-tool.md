- Follow the GitHub Flow for all development work
- Each major feature should be developed in a separate branch
- All code must pass through PR review before merging to main
- Maintain consistent TypeScript typing throughout the project
- Follow Tailwind CSS conventions for styling
- Use Server Actions for data mutations where possible
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback for all operations

## Team Assignment Strategy

**Recommended Distribution for 7 Interns:**

1. **Intern 1**: Project Setup & Foundation (Task 1.0)
2. **Intern 2**: Authentication System (Task 2.0)
3. **Intern 3**: Database Design & Setup (Task 3.0)
4. **Intern 4**: Core Project Management Features (Task 4.0)
5. **Intern 5**: Interactive Kanban Board (Task 5.0)
6. **Intern 6**: Advanced Features & Polish (Task 6.0)
7. **Intern 7**: Testing Implementation (Task 7.0)

**Deployment (Task 8.0)** should be a collaborative effort with guidance from the mentor.

Each intern will be the **primary owner** of their assigned task group but will collaborate with others for integration and knowledge sharing.
